Quick Absorption Rate: With its large surface area and highly porous structure, Activated Coconut Charcoal Powder offers increased absorption capacity as an ingredient in deep-cleansing formulations. Recommended for use in skin care and scalp care.
Powerful Cleansing Properties: By binding to impurities on the skin's surface, Activated Coconut Charcoal promotes easier removal of dirt, oil, and makeup, leaving the skin feeling refreshed and purified.

DESCRIPTION
Activated Coconut Charcoal Powder is a versatile and powerful raw material that is ideal for use in skin care, hair care, and body care formulations. Derived from wood and shells of the coconut, this fine black powder possesses an 8â€“15-micron particle size and is renowned for its deep cleansing and gentle exfoliating properties.
When incorporated in skin care formulations, Activated Coconut Charcoal Powder unclogs pores, drawing out dirt and impurities that can cause congestion. Its soft exfoliating activity makes it gentle enough for sensitive or extra dry skin, as it works without causing irritation. Additionally, regular use can help minimize the appearance of pores by keeping them clear of debris, oil, and buildup, promoting a more refined and even complexion.
In hair care, the Coconut variety of Activated Charcoal Powder aids in purifying the scalp, reducing oiliness, and promoting a refreshed, clean feel.
