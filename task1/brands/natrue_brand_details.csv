In Sanskrit, the classical Indian written language, ‘aman’ means peace or rest and ‘prana’ refers to life energy. Thus, serene life energy.  Amanprana is a range of products that supports and strengthens our life energy serenely without harming our body or mind. In short: gently and without excess. 

Amanprana does not believe in the ‘magic pill’. Amanprana is always organic and vegetarian. Attention is also paid to healthy ecological packaging. We prefer glass over plastic, as it is better for the environ ment, your health and the taste. Whenever possible we print with vegetable inks and on ecological paper. 

At Amanprana we believe in the whole and not in the separate parts. Our products are therefore processed as little as possible and we do not use isolates. Isolates are chemically or naturally fabricated isolated substances that will never be capable of equalling the whole. We do not, for example, add isolated vitamin E but use red palm and wheat germ oil as rich natural sources of vitamin E.

In Slovenia the hemp plant has been cultivated for centuries for use in industry, clothing and skincare. Maybe more than any other country in the world, we really understand this extraordinary plant. Our great-grandparents grew hemp and now we are continuing this important legacy today.
Hemp is naturally rich in CBD which has powerful properties that alleviate and support many skincare problems. We have a dedicated CBD skincare range and we also offer products that do not contain any CBD.

Linden Leaves was founded by Brigit Blair in 1995 in Christchurch, New Zealand to help care for her children who suffered severe eczema and allergies. At the time, effective, natural products suitable for sensitive skin were hard to find, and so out of necessity, Linden Leaves was created.
Brigit began harvesting and freeze-drying roses, and blending fruit and flower oils with the unique scent of essential oil blends. It became a real labour of love for Brigit, who set out to create beautiful, effective and quality handmade natural products that were kind to the skin.
From a humble family kitchen operation, Linden Leaves has expanded into an internationally recognised brand known for its natural everyday luxury handmade products.
Brigit's vision for Linden Leaves is to create beautiful, effective and gentle products to nourish the skin and soothe the soul. 

OUR PHILOSOPHY
Linden Leaves supports ethical and sustainable business practices, and as a devoted mother and wife, family holds an essential place in Brigit's life and values. Linden Leaves is genuinely dedicated to family, friendship and respect for one another and the world we live in.

Our natural botanical ingredients are sourced locally and sustainably wherever possible, in order to attain the highest possible quality of product. 
We avoid the use of chemical nasties and irritants such as parabens, silicon oils, sodium lauryl and genetically modified ingredients.
