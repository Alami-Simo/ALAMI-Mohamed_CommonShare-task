Products contain a proprietary blend of organic plants and compounds that have natural preservative properties, yielding a shelf life of 24 months. \n\n- Custom distillation and extraction – each plant ingredient is extracted according to its specific composition by master distillers who respect this time-honored tradition. This method preserves each plant’s intrinsic healing properties for the skin. \n\n- 100% organic and food grade emulsifiers - ensure absolute purity and safety for both users and the environment. \n\n- No unnecessary ingredient processing – no bleach, deodorizing, refining or gamma radiation. Each plant maintains its original attributes throughout the product development process in order to keep plant properties as pure and effective as in nature itself. \n\n- Fair trade and ethical sourcing – Amala pays a fair price for superior plant ingredients and sources them exclusively from their sustainable farm partners and trusted suppliers around the world. Additionally, five percent of profits are returned to these local communities to help them preserve their culture and achieve long-term economic sustainability. \n\n- 100% natural fragrance - the aroma of pure essential oils and flower extracts.

At the time, effective, natural products suitable for sensitive skin were hard to find, and so out of necessity, Linden Leaves was created.\nBrigit began harvesting and freeze-drying roses, and blending fruit and flower oils with the unique scent of essential oil blends. It became a real labour of love for Brigit, who set out to create beautiful, effective and quality handmade natural products that were kind to the skin.\nFrom a humble family kitchen operation, Linden Leaves has expanded into an internationally recognised brand known for its natural everyday luxury handmade products.\nBrigit's vision for Linden Leaves is to create beautiful, effective and gentle products to nourish the skin and soothe the soul. \n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\nLinden Leaves supports ethical and sustainable business practices, and as a devoted mother and wife, family holds an essential place in Brigit's life and values.
