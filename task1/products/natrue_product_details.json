It absorbs wonderfully and leaves a gentle scent on the skin. In Monika Grundmann’s Crystal Balance Massage, the oil and massage stones are slightly warmed on a small stove. It can also be used selectively on particular parts of the body. «Regeneration» oil, for instance, has been shown to strengthen the bodies natural resistance when applied to the thymus gland, while «Joy Of Life» oil, applied to the soles of the feet, activates the flow of energy. \n - REFLEX ZONE MASSAGE: Since the entire body can be stimulated through the reflex zones (feet, hands, back etc.), gemstone oil is also excellently suited to this method of application. \n - FACIAL OIL: Due to its rapid absorbtion and silky consistency, it is highly recommended for facial massage and facial skincare. \n - BATH OIL: The effect of the oil is enhanced by the warmth of the water. Two tablespoons per bath are sufficient. The skin is soft and velvety, making subsequent oiling unnecessary.",
